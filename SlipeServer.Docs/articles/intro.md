# Slipe Server
Slipe Server is a C# implementation of an MTA San Andreas Server.

## Goals
The goals of Slipe Server is to make an MTA server that's more performant and more configurable. But also more maintainable due to upholding higher code standards.  

Another goal is for Slipe Server to offer a platform to run "resources" in C# instead of Lua. (However Lua is also being worked on). This would allow for running native code for gameplay features where in MTA's own implementation this would all be Lua.
